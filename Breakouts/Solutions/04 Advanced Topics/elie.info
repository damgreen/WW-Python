The opposite of art is not ugliness, it's indifference. 
The opposite of faith is not heresy, it's indifference. 
And the opposite of life is not death, it's indifference."

Before I began to study astrology, for many years I was, and remain,
interested in science. In particular, physics and subatomic physics
(the study of the particle world that comprises atoms and matter) have
always fascinated me. As the years have gone by, I have seen many
correlations between the paradigms and theories of science and
physics, and the more mystical world we deal in when we approach
astrology. In this article, I will try to present some of these
correlations. I wish to state from the outset, however, that I won't
attempt to "ultimately explain" these things.

Pythagoras of Samos (560-480 BCE), is mostly remembered today for the
"Pythagorean Theorem", which relates the length of the sides of a
right triangle (a2 + b2 = c2). This is taught in every Jr. High School
geometry class. He is also remembered, though to a lesser extent, for
his contributions to developments in the fields of mathematics in
general, astronomy, and music theory. What isn't generally remembered
is that Pythagoras was a philosopher, and the founder of a religion
based in great part upon the meanings of numbers - specifically, what
today we call the whole numbers. Astrology borrows from this tradition
in its assignment of meaning to the Aspects, as well as to the
Triplicities and the Quadraplucities, and, thereby, the Signs and
Houses themselves. It is in the Aspects, however, that the
correlations can be seen most clearly. The Square Aspect is the whole
circle divided by the number four (360° ÷ 4 = 90°). The Square
therefore draws its fundamental meaning from the meaning of the number
Four. The same is true of the remaining aspects. Those aspects which
are most commonly used are even called "The Pythagorean Aspects", and
consist of the ...  Love by Numbers

By adding up the numbers of your birth date you’ll find out what your
ruling numerological number is. This is said to be your destiny or
life number. Here’s how you work it out.

Take your day, month and year and add all the numbers together. For
instance if your date of birth is the September 27, 1961, here’s what
you do to work out your destiny number. 2 and 7 = 9, September is the
9th month so that’s another 9. And the year 1,9,6,1 all add up to 17,
then you add 1 and 7 together and it = 8. So now you have 9,9, and 8
which = 26. Then you add the 2 and 6 and it = 8, this is your destiny
number.

Once you have worked your number out, read on to see what type of
numerological flirt you are.
